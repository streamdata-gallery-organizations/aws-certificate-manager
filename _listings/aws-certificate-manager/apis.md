name: AWS Certificate Manager
x-slug: aws-certificate-manager
description: AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision,
  manage, and deploy Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates
  for use with AWS services. SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network communications
  and establish the identity of websites over the Internet. AWS Certificate Manager
  removes the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing
  SSL/TLS certificates. With AWS Certificate Manager, you can quickly request a certificate,
  deploy it on AWS resources such as Elastic Load Balancers or Amazon CloudFront distributions,
  and let AWS Certificate Manager handle certificate renewals. SSL/TLS certificates
  provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager are free. You pay only for the AWS resources
  you create to run your application.
